# BraveAR
We created a fun experience for the ultimate Atlanta Braves fan. When a fan pulls up BravesAR on Argon web browser (available on iOS + Android), they will be presented with information/statistics about the game in a fun and interesting way. We tried to do away with the busy Jumbotrons that display too much in favor of minimalistic ways to present information.
